# Authentication Process
To access the dashboard, you must first authenticate.

Make sure you have imported your node's public address into your wallet (e.g., Metamask, Rabby) before proceeding.

1. Visit https://etherscan.io/verifiedSignatures
2. Click on Sign Message on the top right of the screen
3. Connect your wallet if you haven't already
4. Ensure the selected address is your node's public address
5. Enter 'vitruveo' in the Message field
6. On the next screen, copy the Signature Hash from the bottom section
7. Once completed, please open a ticket on MatroxDex's Discord server to share the signature hash and validator address. You'll then receive the password to access the dashboard.
